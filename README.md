# MSG_mapping

1. The pdf file mapping_table.pdf is the collection of all the mappings results in 1421 MSGs.

   For each MSG, we first list the bases of the null space of the mappings, and all the other invariant sets with zero indicators can be generated by combining these bases.
   
   Then for each nonzero indicator set, we list one possible invariant set. Other possible invariant sets can be generated by adding invariant sets with zero indicators.
   
   The latex file of this table can be generated using the print_table_in_latex() function in generate_mapping.py

2. The python file generate_mapping.py can be used to generate the invariant sets that corresponding to a specific input indicator set of an MSG:

        python generate_mapping msg_num ind_set
    
   where msg_num is a string denoting the BNS number of a magnetic space group (MSG), e.g., '2.4'.
   
   and ind_set is a list of indicator, e.g., '[1,1,1,2]'.
